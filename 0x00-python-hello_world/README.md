<h1> 0x00. Python - Hello, World </h1>
<p> In this project we are expected to learn about python programming </p>
<h2> Learning Objectives </h2>
<h3> General </h3>
<ul>
<li> Why Python programming is awesome </li>
<li> Who created Python </li>
<li> Who is Guido van Rossum </li>
<li> Where does the name ‘Python’ come from </li>
<li> What is the Zen of Python </li>
<li> How to use the Python interpreter </li>
<li> How to print text and variables using print </li>
<li> How to use strings </li>
<li> What are indexing and slicing in Python </li>
<li> What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle </li>
</ul>
<h2> Requirements </h2>
<h3> Python Scripts </h3>
<ul>
<li> Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs </li>
<li> All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) </li>
<li> All your files should end with a new line </li>
<li> The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3 </li>
<li> A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository </li>
<li> A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory </li>
<li> Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.) </li>
<li> All your files must be executable </li>
<li> The length of your files will be tested using wc </li>
</ul>
<h3> Shell Scripts </h3>
<ul>
<li> Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs </li>
<li> All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS </li>
<li> All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2) </li>
<li> All your files should end with a new line </li>
<li> The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash </li>
<li> All your files must be executable </li>
</ul>
<h3> C Scripts </h3>
<ul>
<li> Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs </li>
<li> All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 </li>
<li> All your files should end with a new line </li> 
<li> Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl </li>
<li> You are not allowed to use global variables </li>
<li> No more than 5 functions per file </li>
<li> In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples </li>
<li> The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h </li>
<li> Don’t forget to push your header file </li>
<li> All your header files should be include guarded </li>
</ul>

<h3> Zen </h3>
<p> The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters </p>
<p> Beautiful is better than ugly. <br>
Explicit is better than implicit. <br>
Simple is better than complex. <br>
Complex is better than complicated. <br>
Flat is better than nested. <br>
Sparse is better than dense. <br>
Readability counts. <br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br>
Although practicality beats purity. <br>
Errors should never pass silently. <br>
Unless explicitly silenced. <br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. <br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <br>
Now is better than never. <br>
Although never is often better than *right* now. <br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<h3> Pycodestyle </h3>
<p> Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code </p>
<h3> Tasks </h3>
<h2> 0. Run Python file </h2>
<p> Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. </p>
<p> The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE </p>
<h2> 1. Run inline </h2>
<p> Write a Shell script that runs Python code. </p>
<p> The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE </p>
<h2> 2. Hello, print </h2>
<p> Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. </p>
<ul>
<li> Use the function print </li>
</ul>
<h2> 3. Print integer </h2>
<p> Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line. </p>
<h2> 4. Print float </h2>
<p> Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits. </p>
<h2> 5. Print string </h2>
<p> Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters. </p>
<h2> 6. Play with strings </h2>
<p> Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School! </p>
<h2> 7. Copy - Cut - Paste </h2>
<p> Complete this source code </p>
<h2> 8. Create a new sentence </h2>
<p> Complete this source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line. </p>
<h2> 9. Easter Egg </h2> 
<p> Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line. </p>
<ul>
<li> Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py) </li>
</ul>
<h2> 10. Linked list cycle </h2>
<p> Technical interview preparation: </p>
<ul>
<li> You are not allowed to google anything </li>
<li> Whiteboard first </li>
<li> This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p> Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it. </p>
<ul>
<li> Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t list); </li>
<li> Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle </li>
</ul>
<p> Requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li> Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free </li>
</ul>
